Q 1. A differential pressure transmitter is calibrated 0 to 80 inches of water and transmits a 4 to 20 mA dc signal. This transmitter is placed across an orifice plate which is sized to create 80 inches of water differential 6 gallons per minute. What is the flow rate when the signal is 13 mA dc?<br>
<b>a. 4.5 gpm<br></b>
b. 3.9 gpm<br>
c. 3.4gpm<br>
d. 4.9gpm<br><br>

Q 2. For the equipment described in the preceding question, what will the signal be if the flow rate is 4 gpm?<br>
a. 13.3mA dc<br>
b. 8.9 mA dc<br>
<b>c. 11.2 mA dc<br></b>
d. 6.7 mA dc<br>

Q 3. Assume the line used in Questions 1 and 2, is a 1/2-inch schedule 40 pipe (IV = 0.622 inches). find the orifice bore used to satisfy the conditions given if the measured fluid is water at 60 Deg F<br>
<b>a. 0.352 inches<br></b>
b. 0.190 inches<br>
c. 0.556 inches<br>
d. 0.414 inches<br>

Q 4. The best choice of orifice taps in the preceding problem would be:<br>
a. flange taps<br>
<b>b. corner taps<br></b>
c. vena-contracta taps<br>
d. pipe taps<br>

Q 5.  A 2-inch schedule 40 line (lD = 2.067) is used to carry gasoline (Specific Gravity = 0.75). The flow rate is measured with an orifice plate (d = 1.034) and pipe taps are used. At full flow rate, a differential pressure of 50 inches of water is produced. What is the approximate full flow rate in gpm?<br>
a. 30 gpm<br>
b. 53 gpm<br>
c. 250 gpm<br>
<b>d. 36 gpm<br></b>
