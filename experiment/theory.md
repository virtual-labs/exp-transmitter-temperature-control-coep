## Prerequisite
Standard Instrumentation Signal range

Transmitter is a device that translates the signal produced by a sensor into a standardised instrumentation signal either 3-15 PSI air pressure Or 4-20 mA DC electric current.

The standardized signal to sent to an indicator , a controller or both.

The standard 4 and 20 mA current transmitters are the classical analog transmitters.

## Evolution of transmitters:
* 4 wire
* 3 wire
* 2 wire
* Intelligent/SMART
* Wireless

In 3 wire/4 wire transmitters separate power supply is used to power the sensor and its signal conditioning circuits. These Power supply wires are separate from signal wires carrying 4-20 mA.

* These are also called "self powered"

Advantage: No loading effect

Disadvantage: Expensive due to requirement of more cable length

2 Wire Transmitter Configuration:

only two wires which carry power supply as well as output current signal

* These are also called as "loop powered"
* 4-20 mA current loop interface is the standard for almost all the process control instruments.
* Features
* Only two wires connect sensor (transmitter) and receiver
* DC supply voltage is nominally 24 V DC
* When process parameter is at lowest value
* Current in the loop is 4 mA
* When process parameter is at highest value
* Current in the loop is 20 mA
* 4 mA are used for powering the sensor electronics

* Advantages
* Signal transmission over long distances without signal degradation.
* Broken wire detection ( as the current would drop to zero)
* Short circuit detection ( as the current would drop to zero )
* Dead sensor detection( as the current would drop to zero )

* Low voltage and low current are safe.

* A range of improved transmitters are available in two broad categories
* smart analog transmitters
* intelligent digital transmitters

## Smart Analog Transmitters
